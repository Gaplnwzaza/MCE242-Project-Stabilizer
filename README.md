# MCE242-Project-Stabilizer
This MCE242 project was created by 65070502202 Kantapong Premyodin and 65070502204 Chutipon Likitparinya
The project name is 3-Axis stabilizer with adjust value and PID
NOTE : First we use esp32 to drive motor but esp32 cannot hold that much voltage so we have to use another board 
and that board is Arduino UNO R3 by I2C communication
BEST REGARD.
